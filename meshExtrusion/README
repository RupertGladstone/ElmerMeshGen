To extrude the mesh, simply copy the 2D mesh directory from the refineMesh 
directory and run ElmerSolver.  The .sif file has one solver to output 
results in vtu format.  The line "Extruded Mesh Levels" in the simulation 
section of the .sif instructs Elmer to extrude the 2D mesh.  By default 
the extrusion is linear spaced, but there are other options, see Elmer 
documentation (in particular the "mesh extrusion" section of the 
ElmerSolverManual, section 9.3 at time of writing, available from 
http://www.nic.funet.fi/pub/sci/physics/elmer/doc/).

The resulting .vtu file, in mesh2D directory after running ElmerSolver, 
can be viewed in paraview.  Note the mesh is extruded to unit height by 
Elmer's mesh extrusion, so high vertical exaggeration is needed to see it.

TODO: add solvers to read in bedrock and surface height, add structured mesh 
mapper to map the structured mesh to the new bedrock and surface height.
