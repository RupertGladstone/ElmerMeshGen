! Fab's wording: "Rayon pour le lissage (moindre carr√© 2D quadratique des vitesses)"
! This is effectively a spatial scale over which the velocity data are smoothed.
! Make it too large and velocity gradients will be smoothed out, thus potentially 
! avoiding refinement in regions where it is needed.  Make it too small and you 
! may revert to the missing data value in some regions where no velocity points 
! can be found close enough to your mesh points.  Also, if you have a noisy error 
! -filled velocity field you will need to increase this to avoid refinement due to 
! error noise.  As a rough indicator this could be set to a few times the grid cell 
! size (assuming you have velocity data in a regular grid).

! Velocity threshold to divide "interior" from "fast flow" regions.
! I don't see why this should be needed as the refinement should take care of this. 
! I guess it might be useful to avoid refinement in noisy slow flowing regions, but 
! in such cases increasing R might also solve the problem.
threshold = 999999.9,

! err.  This is an error measure to be satisfied by the refienement.  The 
! smaller the value the greater the refinement (i.e. the finer the mesh 
! resolution).  However, the resolution is always subject to limits set 
! by the next two parameters.
! hmin. Minimum element size
! hmax. Maximum element size

! Parameters for the slow moving interior (ignored if threshold is set very high)
hmin=40000.0,
hmax=40000.0,
err=100.0,

! Parameters for the fast flow regions (or for all regions if threshold is set 
! very high)
hmin2=2000.0,
hmax2=40000.0,
err2=200.0,
