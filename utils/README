csv2geo.py is a python script to convert a csv (comma separated) file to a .geo file, 
using the points to make a spline to form the boundary.

2csv2geo.py is similar to csv2geo.py but for 2 csv files for the case where the two 
files contain parts of the boundary that need separate labelling, such as grounded 
vs floating or calving front boundary.

Example usage:
python csv2geo.py exampleBoundary.csv 

The .geo file can be used in gmsh to create an approximately uniform resolution mesh.

Example usage:
gmsh exampleBoundary.geo -1 -2

This can be viewed in gmsh interactively:
gmsh exampleBoundary.msh &
(double right click on the viewing panel to bring up options for viewing nodes, 
labels etc)
