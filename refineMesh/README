Just run make in this directory to carry out the meshing and mesh refinement.
This uses the code in ../src
You need yams, gmsh and possibly other software installed, see rough notes in ../installNotes.asc

Input files required:
input.txt containing key parameters.
Contour.geo containing a contour of the mesh boundary (in gmsh format).
Ascii file containing velocities.

The latter two of the above files are created in the drawBoundary directory.

Outputs:
Contour.mesh contains the non-refined mesh, viewable in gmsh.
mesh2D_xxx these files are created during the refinement process and include refinement metrics.
mesh2D.msh mesh2D.mesh are slightly different formatted versions of the final refined mesh, viewable in gmsh. 
mesh2D directory contains the final refined mesh in Elmer format.
